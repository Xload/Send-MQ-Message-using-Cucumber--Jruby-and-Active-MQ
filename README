Please ensure the following before running:

The code was developed on Eclipse Indigo and Mac Llion OS


Please Note the code is still under development and has not been Junit tested yet.

At the moment it has two main feature:

1-Send and Receive Messages from JMOS queue and some validations on the received message.
2-Read parameter from data XML pay load and replace it by values from data sheet. for example if I have the param ${User} in the pay load
and in the data sheet I have column name User and the value for the user is Tom then the value within the xml will be replaced from ${Users} to Tom 

Before sending or receiving message please change jndi.properties file to match your URL, queue name or topic name.

You can start by running the features and then have a look at the java class call within rb or the java class using Eclipse.

Last notice:

The code is still under early development and will be changing frequently.
The features and Scenarios are not based on any Business  stories.

I will add a note to every method and class and if you notice that I have forgotten to add any note then please let me know
